The frequency sweep is between 1.5 MHz - 2.5 MHz with a step size of 10 kHz and figure 001 is the 1.5 MHz, figure 002 1.51 MHz and so on until figure 101 which is 2.5 MHz. The letters before the figure number: TAP, TAV and FP, describes if the figure shows the total acoustic pressure (Pa), TAP, the total acoustic velocity (m/s), TAV, or the force potential field (J), FP.
